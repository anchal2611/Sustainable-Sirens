    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>What are sustainable energy practices?</strong><br>
        <p>Sustainable energy practices are methods and technologies that aim to minimize the negative environmental
          impacts of energy production and consumption. These practices prioritize the use of renewable energy sources,
          energy efficiency, and reduced carbon emissions to combat climate change and promote a cleaner, more
          sustainable future.</p>
      </li>
      <p> <br> </p>
      <li>
        <strong>Why should I switch to sustainable energy practices?</strong><br>
        <p>Switching to sustainable energy practices helps reduce your carbon footprint, combat climate change, and
          support a cleaner environment. It can also lower energy costs in the long run and reduce your dependence on
          fossil fuels, which are finite resources.</p>
      </li>
      <p> <br> </p>
      <li>
        <strong>What are some common sustainable energy practices I can adopt as an individual?</strong><br>
        <p>You can start by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Using Renewable Energy: Consider installing solar panels, wind turbines, or subscribing to a green energy
            program.</li>
          <li>Energy Efficiency: Upgrade to energy-efficient appliances, insulate your home, and use smart thermostats
            to reduce energy consumption.</li>
          <li>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Cut down on waste, recycle materials, and use products that are designed for
            longevity.</li>
          <li>Transportation: Choose fuel-efficient vehicles, carpool, use public transportation, or opt for electric
            cars.</li>
          <li>Water Conservation: Conserve water by fixing leaks, using low-flow fixtures, and being mindful of water
            use.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <p> <br> </p>
      <li>
        <strong>What financial incentives are available for switching to sustainable energy practices?</strong><br>
        <p>Depending on your location, there may be various incentives, such as tax credits, rebates, and grants, for
          adopting sustainable energy practices. These incentives can help offset the initial costs of equipment and
          installation.</p>
      </li>
      <p> <br> </p>
      <li>
        <strong>How can I determine the feasibility of renewable energy sources for my home?</strong><br>
        <p>You can assess your home's suitability for renewable energy by considering factors like your location,
          available sunlight (for solar), wind patterns (for wind energy), and the space available for installation. You
          can also consult with local experts or companies that specialize in renewable energy.</p>
      </li>
      <p> <br> </p>
      <li>
        <strong>What role can energy conservation play in sustainable energy practices?</strong><br>
        <p>Energy conservation is a fundamental component of sustainable energy practices. By reducing energy waste
          through efficient appliances, better insulation, and conscious energy use, you can lower your overall energy
          consumption and decrease your environmental impact.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>How can I make my home more energy-efficient?</strong><br>
        <p>You can make your home more energy-efficient by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Upgrading to LED lighting.</li>
          <li>Sealing gaps and insulating your home.</li>
          <li>Installing a programmable or smart thermostat.</li>
          <li>Using energy-efficient appliances.</li>
          <li>Reducing hot water usage.</li>
          <li>Unplugging electronics when not in use.</li>
          <li>Turning off lights and fans when leaving a room.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <p> <br> </p>
      <li>
        <strong>Can I switch to sustainable energy practices if I rent my home or apartment?</strong><br>
        <p>Yes, even as a renter, you can adopt sustainable energy practices. You can use energy-efficient appliances,
          advocate for improvements with your landlord, and choose green energy options if available.</p>
      </li>
      <p> <br> </p>
      <li>
        <strong>How can I encourage my community to embrace sustainable energy practices?</strong> <br>
        <p>You can encourage your community by leading by example, sharing information, and organizing educational
          events. You can also engage with local government and advocate for sustainable energy policies and
          initiatives.</p>
